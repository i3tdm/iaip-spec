# Audit Notes: Unanswered Questions

The following questions could not be answered based on the current audit of the `iaip-spec` repository (v0).

## Business & Strategy
- **5. Business Analyst (ROI):** The specification (`spec/v0`) focuses purely on technical implementation (`file-format`, `resolution`). No business metrics, ROI calculations, or economic analysis models are present.
- **12. Venture Capitalist (Scalability):** While technical modularity (`include.merge`) suggests scalability, there is no documentation regarding business scalability or startup growth cycles.
- **22. Entrepreneur (SaaS):** The project is Apache 2.0 licensed. No commercial features, SaaS tiers, or monetization strategies are documented.
- **26. Investor (Metrics):** No KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) or success metrics are defined to evaluate project success.

## Education & Environment
- **15. Educator (Classroom):** No teaching guides, curricula, or pedagogical notes exist in `notes/` or `spec/`.
- **19. Environmental Scientist (Energy):** The protocol defines text formats and has no component measuring compute power, energy consumption, or sustainability.

## Real World Data
- **20. Journalist (Case Studies):** The `examples/` directory is empty (`.gitkeep` only). No real-world case studies or success stories are documented.
- **25. Psychologist (Cognitive Load):** While `motivation.md` mentions reducing "tiredness," there are no formal user studies or cognitive load assessments.

## Scope Limitations
- **29. Artist (Creative Fields):** `README.md` defines the scope as "software development." Application to creative arts or non-technical fields is not documented.
- **30. Futurist (Multimodal):** `spec/v0/file-format.md` restricts inputs to text/YAML. There is no support or roadmap entry for voice, video, or image inputs in v0.
